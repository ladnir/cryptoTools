=====


CryptoTools is a portable c++14 library containing a collection of tools for building cryptographic protocols. This include asynchronous networking (Boost Asio), several fast primitives such as AES (AES-NI), Blake2, SHA1 (assembly), and eliptic curve crypto (miracl, Relic-Toolkit). There are also several other utilities tailered for implementing protocols.

Thirdparty networking is also supported. See `frontend_cryptoTools/tutorial/Network.cpp` for an example.
  

 
## Install
 
The library is *cross platform* and has been tested on both Windows, Linux and Mac. There are two library dependencies including [Boost 1.69](http://www.boost.org/) (networking), and two **optional dependencies** on, [Miracl](https://www.miracl.com/), [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/) for elliptic curves. The version of Miracl used by this library requires specific configuration and therefore we advise using the cloned repository that we provide. 
 
### Windows

In `Powershell`, this will set up the project 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools
cd cryptoTools/thirdparty/win
getBoost.ps1; 
cd ../..
cryptoTools.sln
```

**Boost and visual studio 2017:**  If boost does not build with visual studio 2017 
follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41464356/build-boost-with-msvc-14-1-vs2017-rc). 

**Enabling Relic (for fast elliptic curves):**
 * Clone the Visual Studio port [Relic](https://github.com/ladnir/relic). 
 * Use the CMake command  `cmake . -DMULTI=OPENMP -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=C:\libs  -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64` generate a Visual Studio solution
 * Optional: Build with gmp/mpir for faster performance. 
 * Install it to `C:\libs` (build the `INSTALL` VS project).
 * Edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to include `#define ENABLE_RELIC`.

**Enabling Miracl (for elliptic curves):**
 * `cd cryptoTools/thirdparty/win`
 * `getMiracl.ps1 ` (If the Miracl script fails to find visual studio 2017,  manually open and build the Miracl solution.)
 * `cd ../..`
 * Edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to include `#define ENABLE_MIRACL`.

**IMPORTANT:**
 By default, the build system needs the NASM compiler to be located
at `C:\NASM\nasm.exe`. In the event that it isn't, there are two options, install it, 
or enable the pure c++ implementation:
 * Remove  `cryptoTools/Crypto/asm/sha_win64.asm` from the cryptoTools Project.
 * Edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to remove `#define ENABLE_NASM`.

**Other options:**
 * The implementation of binary circuits in cryptoTools (`BetaCircuit`) can be enabled by edit the config file [libOTe/cryptoTools/cryptoTools/Common/config.h](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools/blob/master/cryptoTools/Common/config.h) to include `#define ENABLE_CIRCUITS`.

Build the solution within visual studio or with `MSBuild`. To see all the command line options, execute the program 

`frontend.exe` 
  


 
 
### Linux
 
 In short, this will build the project (without elliptic curves)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe.git
cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux
bash boost.get
cd ../../..
make
```

This will build the minimum version of the library (wihtout elliptic curves). The libraries 
will be placed in `libOTe/lib` and the binary `frontend_libOTe` will be placed in 
`libOTe/bin` To see all the command line options, execute the program 
 
`./bin/frontend_libOTe`


**Enable elliptic curves using:**
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_RELIC=ON`: Build the library with integration to the 
      [Relic](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/) library. Requires that
      relic is built with `cmake . -DMULTI=OPENMP` and installed.
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_MIRACL=ON`: Build the library with integration to the
     [Miracl](https://www.miracl.com/) library. Requires building miracl 
 `   cd libOTe/cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux; bash miracl.get`.

**Other Options:**
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_CIRCUITS=ON`: Build the library with the circuit library enabled.
 * `cmake .  -DENABLE_NASM=ON`: Build the library with the assembly base SHA1 implementation. Requires the NASM compiler.
 


**Note:** In the case that miracl or boost is already installed, the steps 
`cd cryptoTools/thirdparty/linux; bash boost.get` can be skipped and CMake will attempt 
to find them instead. Boost is found with the CMake findBoost package and miracl
is found with the `find_library(miracl)` command.
